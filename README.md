# Security Operations and Monitoring Framework

## Overview
This project simulates an IT Security Operations framework that includes vulnerability scanning, log monitoring, intrusion detection, and incident response. It provides a toolkit to simulate the operations of a Security Operations Center (SOC).

## Structure
- **Config**: Configuration files for vulnerability scanning, IDS rules, and log monitoring.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for security scanning, detection, monitoring, and reporting.
- **Playbooks**: Incident response and vulnerability management playbooks.
- **Docs**: Security policies, threat modeling, and compliance guidelines.

## Setup
1. Configure settings in the `config/` files.
2. Run scripts in `scripts/` to initiate security scans and monitoring.
3. Use playbooks in `playbooks/` for incident response and management.
